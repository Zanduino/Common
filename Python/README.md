# Python
All Python scripts  are stored in this directory

## build_platform.py
Script cloned from[Adafruit CI](https://github.com/adafruit/ci-arduino) and slightly modified which will test-compile
the programs on selected platforms.

## run-clang-format.py
Script to recursively check all c++ files for adherence to the format defined in the .clang-format file. This is
basically the "Google" style with a handful of minor adjustments
